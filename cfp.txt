SUBMISSIONS INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------

SEBD 2024 invites research, industry, application contributions, and software demonstration submissions. Regular papers presenting original work are solicited. Moreover, discussion papers containing descriptions of results already published are also welcomed.

There are three submission formats:

- Regular papers (up to 12 pages + references). Original research works. Regular papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.

- Discussion papers (up to 8 pages + references). Results and ideas of interest to the SEBD audience, including extended abstracts of recent authors’ publications, papers currently under submission, position papers, system and application descriptions, and presentations of preliminary results.

- Doctoral Consortium papers (up to 6-7 pages, including selected references). The papers should be singly authored by a Ph.D. student or a Ph.D. graduate who defended the thesis between September 2023 and February 2024; if accepted, it will be presented at the Doctoral Consortium session.
Selection will be based on originality, clarity, and technical quality.

Submissions of papers must be in English, in PDF format, and formatted following the new CEUR-ART 1-column style, which is the style requested for the camera-ready preparation. The template can be found on Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw).

Submission system: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SEBD2024/

All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings, with Discussion Papers marked as such. Proceedings will be published on WS-CEUR.org and indexed in Scopus.

After acceptance, authors are required to re-submit the final PDF. No different format is allowed. All accepted papers are expected to be presented at the conference, and at least one author will be required to register for the conference.

To accommodate a potentially large number of papers, PC chairs could accommodate poster sessions in addition to regular oral sessions.  A booster session will introduce all poster presentations where the authors can pitch the contribution with a 1-2 minute presentation.
Authors of accepted papers will be notified about the final decision on the presentation format. 

DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM
-----------

The SEBD 2024 Doctoral Consortium will take place in a dedicated session during the
32nd Italian Symposium on Advanced Database Systems (SEBD 2024), Villasimius,
Sardinia (Italy), June 23-26 2024, https://sebd2024.unica.it/.
The goal is to provide a forum for Ph.D. candidates to present their ongoing research and
receive feedback from renowned and experienced research community members. The
Consortium fosters a collaborative environment, encouraging constructive discussions and
sharing of ideas. It will be an excellent opportunity for developing person-to-person networks
to the benefit of the Ph.D. students in their future careers – as well as of the community.

Doctoral Consortium Day: Sunday, June 23, 2024
