## THE AWARD ##

SEBD (Symposium on Advanced Database System) is the major annual event of the Italian database research community. It is thought of as a gathering forum to meet, discuss, and exchange experiences among all people from academia and industry who are interested in database systems and in all their broad range of applications.
SEBD 2022 marked the 30th edition, a remarkable achievement, representing a tangible trace of the scientific contributions of the Italian database community, its evolution over a long period of time, and its liveliness. To celebrate this achievement, SEBD 2022 introduced the ‚ÄúTaste of Time‚Äù Award (TTA) whose purpose is to recognize seminal contributions and to retrace the history of the Italian database community by selecting significant (AND TASTY üòÅ) papers from past editions of SEBD.

SEBD 2024 continues this brand new tradition and calls for nominations for the TTA 2024!

The ultimate goal of the TTA is to keep the tradition of the SEBD community alive, to contextualize the most important research lines and make sense of their evolution, and to inspire new generations of researchers by discussing how key challenges have been addressed, which ones are still open, and what can follow-up from them.


## CRITERIA ##

The SEBD Steering Committee will select papers based on the following impact criteria:
 - impact within (a subarea of) the database research community
 - impact outside of the database research community
 - impact on the non-research community

Papers eligible for the TTA are either original research published at SEBD or extended abstracts of papers published in main venues for the database community.

In both cases evidence about the impact of the paper (or related paper, in case of extended abstracts) has to be provided, e.g., follow-up works (papers, systems, ...), new theories and models, social and/or industrial impact, citations, ...


The TTA will consider, each year, a scrolling window of 3 years, starting from the first SEBD 1993, from which to select papers for the TTA.

The SEBD community is very welcome to nominate papers deemed deserving of the TTA. Eligible papers for this round are those published in:
 - 3rd SEBD 1995: Ravello, Italy ([paper list](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sebd/sebd1995.html ))
 - 4th SEBD 1996: Pisa, Italy ([paper list](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sebd/sebd1996.html ))
 - 5th SEBD 1997: Verona, Italy ([paper list](https://dblp.org/db/conf/sebd/sebd1997.html))
