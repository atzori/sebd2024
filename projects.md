*The DEMON project has received funding from the Italian Research Ministry through the PRIN 2022 call (project code: 2022BAXSPY)*
To study information manipulation we plan to adapt and extend techniques from NLP (to automatically process text) and data/network science (to study information diffusion in online social networks), such as to eventually detect and evaluate the extent to which specific stories are being exploited or weaponized by (malicious) actors in the online information ecosystem.

Duration: 10/2023-9/2025

## SERICS Security and Rights in CyberSpace Spoke 10: Governance e protezione dei dati
#### Reference: Prof. Pierangela Samarati (Università degli Studi di Milano); Prof. Giuseppe Polese (Università di Salerno); Dr. Stefano Cirillo (Università di Salerno)


The SERICS (Security and Rights in CyberSpace) Spoke 10 project has received funding from the PNRR Funding Program.

The modern digital society is increasingly based on the collection, sharing, and analysis of large datasets, offering clear advantages from both personal and business perspectives, as well as benefits for research and society at large. The full realization of a data-driven digital society can only occur if there is trust in the security and privacy of the data itself, and therefore, if solutions are available to ensure its proper protection and use. Data protection laws and regulations impose restrictions that limit its use, and individuals, as well as companies, demand compliance with protection requirements and assurance of effective protection of their data. TA 10 addresses this need by aiming to ensure that the various stakeholders involved in data sharing have access to tools and scenarios for controlling their data, supporting selective and secure data sharing while guaranteeing functionality, efficiency, and scalability. The data protection solutions developed within the framework of TA 10 will enable and encourage new application scenarios and introduce new opportunities for data sharing in a controlled manner, respecting privacy and access restrictions, and ensuring the integrity of the data and the results of the analyses. Thus, TA 10 will contribute to the true and full realization of digital sovereignty.
